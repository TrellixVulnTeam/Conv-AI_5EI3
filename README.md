# ðŸ¦„ Building a State-of-the-Art Conversational AI with Transfer Learning

The present repo forked the code accompanying the blog post [ðŸ¦„ How to build a State-of-the-Art Conversational AI with Transfer Learning](https://medium.com/@Thomwolf/how-to-build-a-state-of-the-art-conversational-ai-with-transfer-learning-2d818ac26313).

I added a Flask app to generate a Conversational AI prototype with the help of Javascript and Firebase database. Currently the code requires a GPU and supports only the OpenAIGPT language model. 

## Installation

To install and use the training and inference scripts please clone the repo and install the requirements:



## Pretrained model

We make a pretrained and fine-tuned model available on our S3 [here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/models.huggingface.co/transfer-learning-chatbot/finetuned_chatbot_gpt.tar.gz). The easiest way to download and use this model is just to run the `interact.py` script to talk with the model. Without any argument, this script will automatically download and cache our model.

## ToDo

Add code to plug a GPT2 pretrained model and to fine tune one as well.
